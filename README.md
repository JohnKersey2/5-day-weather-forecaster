# 5 Day Weather Forecaster

For this project, I was to create a front end application that utilized WeatherAPI API calls to display weather forecasts.

## Link to Deployed Application

<https://github.com/JohnKersey2/5-day-weather-forecaster>


## Criteria 

I was to be able to search for a city. When that city returned, the page should display current whether conditions, as well as a 5 day forecast. Additionally, you should be able to save and store a search history that a user can click on to pull up that city again.

## Known Issues

Forecast system not displaying correctly

History not properly implemented.
